# Staffing and scheduling flexible call centers by queueing theory and integer programming
## by Hammed Jimoh


#Abstract

This project focuses on the problem of staffing and shift scheduling in a multi-shift, flexible call center. Unlike the general approach, which considers staffing level for the entire day and leaves the decision of shift scheduling at the lowest cost to integer programming, this work considers staffing level at each 15-minute time slot, and I obtain optimal staff-schedule by integrating queuing theory approach with flexible integer programming.
